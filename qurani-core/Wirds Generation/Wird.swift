/**
A wird is a set of ayat grouped togather from one index to a specified count, created as a sub-range of ayat for a specific ayat range description, a wird is always a closed range of ayat, and it doesn't matter if it's a sura or something else as long as it's an ayat!

Examples of Wirds might:
- SuraWird
- JuzWird
- AyatRangeWird
- RukuWird

Once a wird is generated, it's saved alongside with the ayat range description, where each ayat range description has a list of wirds.
