	So, we have ayat range description, which represents a range of ayat encapsulated with information, one and most famous example is Sura, which describes a range of ayat in the holy quran, and has specific attributes.

	Another type is Juz, which is also an ayat range description, with a name.

	A range description usually used to represent a closed range of ayat, usually to give the client the ability to split the range into 'wirds'.
